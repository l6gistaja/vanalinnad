Adding new historical map to application
----------------------------------------

Following describes new map adding process with Debian Linux 6.0.8.

1. Optionally, cut away (or whiten) edges, legends, empty areas etc from original map. It makes tile generation speed, repo size and download speed smaller.
1. Install [GDAL utils](http://www.gdal.org/) (in Debian: ```apt-get install gdal-bin```)
1. [Georeference](https://github.com/l6gistaja/vanalinnad/blob/master/raster/places/Tallinn/1968/gdal.txt) source map image: ```gdal_translate {SOURCE_IMAGE_FILE}  {GEOREFERENCED_PNG_FILE} -of PNG ``` ```-gcp {X_COORDINATE_OF_GCP_ON_SOURCE_IMAGE} {Y_COORDINATE_OF_GCP_ON_SOURCE_IMAGE}``` ```{EAST_COORDINATE_OF_GCP} {NORTH_COORDINATE_OF_GCP}```. Choose and specify image (in pixels) and geographical coordinates of at least 3 G(round)C(ontrol)P(oint)s. For example, GCPs can be narrow crossroads which are on both historic and modern maps. You can use ```dev/coords.html``` for finding GCPs geographical coordinates.
1. Install [MapTiler](http://www.maptiler.org/)
1. Generate tiles: open MapTiler > choose Google Maps compatible > Continue > Add > choose ```{GEOREFERENCED_PNG_FILE}``` > Continue > choose WGS84 - Latitude and longitude  > Continue > choose zoom levels > choose JPEG as file format > Continue > choose output directory for tiles (```raster/places/{PLACE}/{YEAR}/tiles```) > Continue > choose Google Maps and OpenLayers > Continue > Continue > Render
1. Optionally, throw away empty tiles:  ```cd dev/jpg2png/ ; ./replace.bash ../../raster/places/{PLACE}/{YEAR}/tiles/```. For that step you need [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)
1. Add ```<layer type="tms" year="{YEAR}" bounds="{WEST_SOUTH_EAST_NORTH}"/>``` to [```vector/places/{PLACE}/layers.xml```](https://github.com/l6gistaja/vanalinnad/blob/master/vector/places/Tallinn/layers.xml). You can get boundingbox from line ```mapBounds = new OpenLayers.Bounds({WEST,SOUTH,EAST,NORTH});``` from file [```raster/places/{PLACE}/{YEAR}/tiles/openlayers.html```](https://github.com/l6gistaja/vanalinnad/blob/master/raster/places/Tallinn/1968/tiles/openlayers.html).
1. Regenerate BBoxes info: ```dev/genbbox.pl {VANALINNAD_ROOT_DIR} {PLACE}```
1. Optionally, add map description to [```vector/places/{PLACE}/rss{YEAR}.xml```](https://github.com/l6gistaja/vanalinnad/blob/master/vector/places/Tallinn/rss1968.xml). You can use [```vector/rsstemplate.xml```](https://github.com/l6gistaja/vanalinnad/blob/master/vector/rsstemplate.xml) as template. Extra tag legends is comma separated list of legend image filenames under [```raster/places/{PLACE}/{YEAR}/```](https://github.com/l6gistaja/vanalinnad/tree/master/raster/places/Tallinn/1968).
